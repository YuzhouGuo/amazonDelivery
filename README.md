# amazonDelivery
A basic code outline that Amazon may use to automate their warehouses. The core of this program is the corporation between different classes: Box, Urgent box, Shelf and Warehouse. A intelligent working system is built and capable to put boxes in appropriate status and position according to their size and prority. 

 * All files except "Tester.java" are source code.
 * The "Tester.java" file is here to check if algorithms here make sense: Creating boxes with different prorities and sizes, put them into the warehourse to see if all boxes are at where they are supposed to be.
 * A nice practice of mergeSort.
